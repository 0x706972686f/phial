An incredibly basic phishing website developed in flask.

Browse to http://domain.com and it'll redirect you to google. Browse to http://domain.com/login and you'll get a simple form of username and password. This will be sent to an email address of your choice.

The email will include the user agent, originating IP address, username and password.
